// Brand and site colors are set here as SCSS variables, so
// that we can use Sass functions to auto generate skewed
// colors from them.
// --------------------------------------------------------

// Set your gray scaling:
$gray-darkest: #373a3c;
$gray-dark: #55595c;
$gray: #818a91;
$gray-light: #eceeef;
$gray-lightest: #f7f7f9;

// Pick your exact brand colors:
$brand-red: #f13c20;
$brand-blue: #4056a1;
$brand-blue-light: #c5cbe3;
$brand-gold: #d79922;
$brand-white: #efe2ba;

// Then map those brand colors to the primary design elements:
$bg-color: #fff;
$text-color: $gray-darkest;
$brand-color-primary: $brand-gold;

// These are auto-generated color skews, you probably won't
// need to change them. If you do, be sure to make sure the
// color contrasts are within safe accessibility ranges.
$brand-color-primary-offset: darken($brand-color-primary, 6%);
